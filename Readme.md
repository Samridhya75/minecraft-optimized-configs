## Tips 101

### If you are running your minecraft server on a free host(Aternos,Falixnodes,Minehut etc.) then you should do the following (*i know you guys broke xD*):
- **Pregen your world**- Free hosts typically have 1 or 2 threads allocated to a server for which you dont get the best performance. To prevent overloading of your server when someone loads chunks while travelling, you should pregenerate your worlds. This way your server dont need to do extra work for generating new chunks. You can pregen using these plugins [Chunky](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/) and [FCP](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-chunk-pregenerator.74429/).
- **Dont use cracked plugins**- You should never use cracked plugins aka plugins that are paid  but available on illegal sites(blackspigot,spigotunlocked etc). They often contain malware and backdoors which have serious effect on your server. Your server files and personal info are at risk. Always download plugins from verified/official sites. In case of malware infection or backdoor, delete all the jars files and make a new server if possible.
- **Take backups**- Backups are very important for keeping your server data safe. In case of data corruption or having to rollback cause of exploits or other reasons, backups is your messiah. You can do manual backups on your PC(recommended) or use a plugin to do it. [DrivebackupV2](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/drivebackupv2.79519/) is a plugin that can do automated backups to Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or FTP/SFTP server.

### Administration

- Lag measuring- Lag is mainly determined by mspt(milliseconds per tick). You should use tools like [Spark](https://spark.lucko.me) to investigate. Read Spark's documentation for more info.  
In spark, the command `/spark tps` shows TPS(ticks per second) and Tick durations of the server. The main values to look into are:  
`Tick durations- min,95%tile and max`  
If these three values are in green then the server is not lagging. Lower the number the better the server is performing. Anything above 50 mspt means the server is struggling.
